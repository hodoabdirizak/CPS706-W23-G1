## About the Project

### Overview
This program is an education tool that visualizes the implementation of centralized and decentralized algorithms in routing. 

### Technologies Used 
We used the following Python libraries:
- Tkinter, to implement the GUI
- Pygame, to animate the Centralized and Decentralized Algorithms
- NetworkX, to create and manipulate the graphs
- Matplotlib, to depict the graphs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This program requires Python version 3.10 or later. <br>

### Running the Program
1. Clone this repository. 
2. In terminal, cd into the root of the repository.
3. Run the following commands to install the necessary libraries: <br>
    - `pip install pygame` <br>
    - `pip install networkx` <br>
    - `pip install matplotlib` <br>
3. To execute the program, run `python gui/frames.py`

## Program Features

### Network Customization
We added an Update Graph feature to our application to give our users the flexibility to customize graphs according to their needs. The user is able to create a new custom graph and edit a current existing graph. Users can clear the current graph display by going back to the main window, then progressing to the next page then entering values in the entry textboxes and clicking ‘Add Record’. To edit a current graph, the user highlights the connections you want to modify, click ‘Select Record’, update the nodes or weight in the entry text boxes, and hit ‘Update Record’. Users can also add new rows to the graph object by entering values in the entry textboxes and clicking ‘Add Record’.

### Guided Implementation of Centralized Algorithm
After choosing 'Run Centralized Algorithm', a descirption of the centeralized algorithm used (dijkstra's algorithm) is displayed in a pop-up window.
Then, you click on any key to move on to the animation of the algorithm. In the animation, the graph is shown on the right side and next to it is a table with the nodes, the distance from the start node, and parent node. By clicking on the right arrow on the keyborad, you will see the table being populated according to dijkstra's alogrithm after each click. After the whole table has been updated, the shortest path will be portrayed on the screen. Then another animation will appear where the shortest path will be highlighted in green and the current node will be highlighted in red. Use the arrow keys to move from one node to the next, and as you move the cost at the top right corner of the screen will be updated to portray the addition of the edge costs being added to give the final cost of the shortest path. After you have moved from the source to the destination you can click ESC on your keyboard to quit the animation. 
### Guided Implementation of Decentralized Algorithm
After choosing 'Run Decentralized Algorithm', a description of the decenteralized algorithm used (Bellman Fords’s algorithm) is displayed in a pop-up window. Then, you click on any key to move on to the animation of the algorithm.  In the animation, there will be the distance vectors for the selected starting and ending network starting at time 0. By using left/right arrow keys, you can increment/decrement time, and it will display states of the distance vectors at that time of that second. As you continue to click the right arrow key, you will see the distance vectors updating, until all the lowest costs have been populated. After that will be a final screen that displays the lowest cost, the path going from the starting to ending network, and the path highlighted in green on the network graph. Then you can click ESC to quit the animation.

## Code 

### Centralized Algorithm
[Code in the `centralized` folder](https://github.com/hodoabdirizak/CPS706-W23-G1/tree/main/centralized)<br>
This folder contains the file [`dijkstra.py`](https://github.com/hodoabdirizak/CPS706-W23-G1/blob/main/centralized/dijkstra.py)
This file implements Dijkstra's algorithm and is used to generate the tables and shortest path for a networkx graph. 

### Decentralized Algorithm
[Code in the `decentralized` folder](https://github.com/hodoabdirizak/CPS706-W23-G1/tree/main/dentralized)<br>
This folder contains the file [`bellman_ford.py`](https://github.com/hodoabdirizak/CPS706-W23-G1/blob/main/decentralized/bellman_ford.py)
This file implements Bellman Ford's algorithm and is used to generate the distance vectors and shortest path for a networkx graph. 

### GUI
[Code in the `GUI` folder](https://github.com/hodoabdirizak/CPS706-W23-G1/tree/main/dentralized)<br>
This folder contains the following files:<br>
`frames.py`
- Contains the Main frame (the page first seen by the user upon executing the program) and Page1 frame (the page after passing input validation).
- Calls the approriate pygame based on user interaction. 
- Terminates the program when user presses the ESC button. 

`homepage.py`
- Used to validate the information entered by the user in the first frame. Returns an appropriate error message to `frames.py`

`create_graph.py`
- Given the data provided by the user in the Main frame, creates a randomized networkx graph and graph.png
- Given the data provided by the user in the Page1 frame, creates a customized networkx graph and graph.png
- The networkx graph is the foundation for all other files.

`centralized_pygame.py`
- Contains the code for the pygame that gets executed after the user selects the "Run centralized algorithm" button on the second page of the gui.
- Provides a description of Dijkstra's algorithm in routing.
- User proceeds to the first part of the animation by pressing any key.
- Each time the user presses the right arrow key, it shows the table being updated, stepping through each part of the algorithm.
- After the table has been completed, it backtracks the table to find the shortest path. 
- User proceeds to the second part of the animation by pressing any key.
- Each time the user presses the right arrow key, it shows the next node in the shortest path being visited in the graph. 
- Pygame terminates when the user presses the ESC key. 

`decentralized_pygame.py`
- Contains the code for the pygame that gets executed after the user selects the "Run decentralized algorithm" button on the second page of the gui.
- Provides a description of Bellman Ford's algorithm in routing. 
- User proceeds to the first part of the animation by pressing any key.
- Each time the user presses the right arrow key, it shows the distance vectors being updated, stepping through each part of the algorithm.
- After the table has been completed, it displays the shortest path and the final graph with the visited nodes highlighted. 
- Pygame terminates when the user presses the ESC key.
